#Lecture
In this class we will implement two projects. The first will have us implement
while and for loops. The second will be a class project implemented from small
contributions of each team.

## For loop Review
As a reminder, a for loop is used to execute a block of code a set number of
times. The number of execution times is known before the code block is entered.

### Exercise 1
Write a for loop that prints your name 10 times.

### Exercise 2
Write a for loop that iterates 3 times. On each iteration, the code should
prints your name 3 times, and then print the iteration number, starting from 0.
The output of the first two iterations is demonstrated below.

```java
Jonathan
Jonathan
Jonathan
Iteration 0
Jonathan
Jonathan
Jonathan
Iteration 1
```

### Exercise 3
Write a for loop that iterates 3 times. On each iteration, the code should print
your name 3 times, and then prints the iteration number and total number of
times your names has been printed to the screen. The output of the first two
iterations is demonstrated below.

```java
Jonathan
Jonathan
Jonathan
Iteration 0. Jonathan printed 3 times
Jonathan
Jonathan
Jonathan
Iteration 1. Jonathan printed 6 times.
```

### Exercise 4
An example program is below. It's purpose is to iterate as many times as there
are letters
